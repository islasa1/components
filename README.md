# Components 
### _A collection of generic programming tools_

## Synopsis
This repository is a collection of generic programming tools not specific to any
one single code project. It exists as part of an effor to aid the C++ code bases 
of [Komorebi Games](https://github.com/KomorebiGames/).

## Reuired Software
This software is designed with the intent to run on a Unix/Linux environment. Certain aspects may be able to compile for Windows, but there is no guartantee it will. 
  
Building requires at least:  
__[cmake v3.5.0](https://cmake.org/download/)__  
__gcc 4.6__     
__c++11__  
_[Google Test Repository](https://github.com/google/googletest)_ 

## Build & Installation
To build this repository perform an out-of-source build. This means we will compile the code in a directory tha is not part of the source files. Steps in 
`this font` are to be typed verbatim on the terminal.
Steps:
 
1. `cd build` _[or where ever you plan to build]_
2. `cmake ..` _[any cmake defines]_
3. `make -j12` _[or `-j32` if you're real fancy]_
4. You're done! You can now use the libComponents.so as part of your build and use the includes.
